# Deep_learning

Survival Analysis of the Customer Churn: The goal is to build a deep learning (neural network) model which predicts business decision-making process to describe customer behaviour during the time period before they stop doing business with us.It helps in planning the business of the company and cost effectiveness.Basically, it is end-to-end model with deployment to AWS/Heroku platform integrated to the web application.
 
Technology: 
•	Programming language and IDE: Python, PyCharm
•	Feature engineering using python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib, tensorflow, keras sciket-learn etc.
•	Segmented data by Clusters using K-means++ algorithm.
•	Deep Learning algorithm.
•	Flask as web application, AWS/ Heroku as a cloud deployment platform.
•	SQL as Data Base Integration
